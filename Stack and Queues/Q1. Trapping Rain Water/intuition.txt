Trapping Rainwater problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that asks how much water can be trpped between the bars of varying heights after a rainstorm.
Water can only be stored above a bar if it is surrounded by taller bars on both left and right sides. 
The amount of water stored depends on the shorter height of these two bars because water spills over the shorter one.

Numerically, water at Ith index = 
    water[i] = min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i]

where:
    leftMax[i] = max height of bars to the left of i
    rightMax[i] = max height of bars to the right of i
    height[i] = height of current bar
