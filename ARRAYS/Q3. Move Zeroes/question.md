# Q3. Move Zeroes

LeetCode: [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`s to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

## Sample Test Cases

- Input: `nums = [0,1,0,3,12]`
  Output: `[1,3,12,0,0]`

- Input: `nums = [0]`
  Output: `[0]`

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
