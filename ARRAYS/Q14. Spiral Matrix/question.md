# Q14. Spiral Matrix

LeetCode: [Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/)

Given an `m x n` matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

## Sample Test Cases

- Input: `matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`
  Output: `[1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]`

- Input: `matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]`
  Output: `[1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]`

## Constraints

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`
