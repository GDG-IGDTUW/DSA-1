# Q15. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others

You are given an integer array `nums` where the largest integer is unique.

Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return the index of the largest element, or return `-1` otherwise.

## Sample Test Cases

- Input: `nums = [3,6,1,0]`
  Output: `1`
  Explanation: `6` is at least twice as big as every other number in the array.

- Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
  Output: `-1`
  Explanation: `4` is not at least twice as big as `3`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
