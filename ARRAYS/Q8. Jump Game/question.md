# Q8. Jump Game

LeetCode: [Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)

You are given an integer array `nums` where each element represents your maximum jump length from that position. You start at the first index of the array, and you want to reach the last index.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

## Sample Test Cases

- Input: `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`
  Output: `true`
  Explanation: Jump `1` step from index `0` to `1`, then `3` steps to the last index.

- Input: `nums = [3,2,1,0,4]`
  Output: `false`
  Explanation: You will always end up at index `3`, which has a jump length of `0`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
