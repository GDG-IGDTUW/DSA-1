# Q6. Product of Array Except Self

LeetCode: [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and does not use the division operation.

## Sample Test Cases

- Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
  Output: `[24,12,8,6]`

- Input: `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`
  Output: `[0,0,9,0,0]`

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` fits in a 32-bit integer.
