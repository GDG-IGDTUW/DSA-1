# Q7. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive, there is exactly one repeated number in `nums`.

Return the repeated number. You must solve the problem without modifying the array and using only constant extra space.

## Sample Test Cases

- Input: `nums = [1,3,4,2,2]`
  Output: `2`

- Input: `nums = [3,1,3,4,2]`
  Output: `3`

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
