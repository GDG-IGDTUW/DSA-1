INTUITION:
The solution correctly identifies whether the list is a palindrome by comparing the first half with the reversed second half.

ALGORITHM:
1. Find the middle element using Tortoise-Hare Algorithm.

2. Reverse the second half of linked list.

3. Compare both the halves.

4. Before returning the answer, make sure to reverse the last half of linked list to original.

5. Finally return true or false.
