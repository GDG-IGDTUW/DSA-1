There can be mmore than 1 peak.

We'll check if arr[mid] is strictly greater than arr[mid + 1] and strictly greater than arr[mid - 1].

But this condition has following 3 errors:
    1. If array size is 1, then we'll simply return 0 as the answer, as this single element will be the peak element
            eg; [2] can be thought of as:
                                            (- infinity) [2] (- infinity)

    2. If the mid points to first index i.e, 0, then we'll check if arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]: If yes, return 0
            eg; [2, 1], where mid points to 0th index i.e, 2, so array can be thought of as:
                                            (- infinity) [2, 1]

    3. If the mid points to last index i.e, n-1, then we'll check if arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1]: If yes, return (n - 1).
            eg; [1, 2], where mid points to (n - 1)th index i.e, 2, so array can be thought of as:
                                            [1, 2] (- infinity)
