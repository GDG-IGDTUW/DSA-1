Given an array of points where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points is the Euclidean distance.

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1  
Output: [[-2,2]]

Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2  
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
