You have k lists of sorted integers in non-decreasing order. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.
We define the range [a, b] is smaller than range [c, d] if b - a < d - c or a < c if b - a == d - c.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
Output: [1,1]
