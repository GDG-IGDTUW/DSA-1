* The goal is to maximize the number of children who can be assigned cookies and a child can be assigned a cookie 
if and only if the cookie that is being given has size greater than or equal to the greed factor of child so that
the child is satisfied.

-> To maximize the number of children given cookies, we must ensure that the smaller cookies are checked for the children with 
smaller greed factor so that less number of cookies remain which are not assigned to any children
-> Hence, we use greedy approach and try to assign the maximum no. of cookies. For that, we sort both the arrays
and check if a cookie can be assigned to a child by keeping Two Pointers on both the arrays first index
-> If a child can be assigned a cookie, then we will move both the pointers and if we cant assign a cookie to 
a child that means that the size of cookie is less than the greed factor of child => all the children after this
child will also have a greater greed factor => therefore, they cannot be assigned the cookie as well=> Hence,
we will move the pointer on size array

For eg. greed={4,5,8,3,2}, size={3,2,1,4}

--> after sorting arrays look like :
    greed={2,3,4,5,8}, size={1,2,3,4}

--> keep a left pointer on greed and right pointer on size
--> we will move the left pinter as well as the right pointer if a cookie can be assigned
and only right pointer if a cookie cant be assigned
--> for eg. check if is 1>=2 => answer is NO => therefore, we will move r pointer to index 1
    and check if is 2>=2 => YES => therfore, we will increment the counter that a child hhas been assigned a cookie and so on...
