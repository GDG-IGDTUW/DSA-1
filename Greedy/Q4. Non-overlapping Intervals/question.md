Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: Removing [1,3] makes the rest non-overlapping.

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]  
Output: 2
