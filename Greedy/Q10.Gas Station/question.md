There are `n` gas stations arranged in a circle.  
You are given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, where `gas[i]` is the amount of gas at the ith station and `cost[i]` is the cost to travel to the next station.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return `-1`.

Example 1:

Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]  
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]  
Output: -1
