There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane.  
The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]`.

An arrow can be shot vertically and will burst all balloons whose horizontal diameter overlaps the arrow.

Return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

Example 1:

Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]  
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]  
Output: 4
