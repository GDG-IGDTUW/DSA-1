*In the question, we have to check whether we can place the number of flowers given in such a way that no two flowers 
are planted adjacent to each other. (0-> empty place, 1-> planted area)

// To solve this, we have to keep in mind that a plant can only be planted if its left and right adjacent neighbours 
are not already occupied.
Therefore, we have to check if the side neighbour values are equal to 0

// But what if index values 0 and last are also not occupied (arr[0]==0 || arr[last]==0), for that, 
1. if index value is equal to 0, we can say that left position is not existing (index -1), therefore, from left its safe
   and for right we have to check for arr[i+1] value (it should be equal to 0 for plant to be placed)
2. if index value id last, we can say that right position is out of array bounds, therefore we are safe from right
   but for left we have to check if arr[i-1]==0

// Therefore, for every index we have to check if its not occupied, if we are safe from left side and right side,
then we can place the flower there 
// If the number of flowers placed becomes equal to n value given, we can return true else we return false
