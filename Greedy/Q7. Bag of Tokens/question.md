You are given an integer array `tokens` and an integer `power`.

You can play tokens in two ways:
- If you have at least `tokens[i]` power, you may spend power to gain 1 score.
- If you have at least 1 score, you may lose 1 score to gain `tokens[i]` power.

Return the maximum score you can achieve.

Example 1:

Input: tokens = [100], power = 50  
Output: 0

Example 2:

Input: tokens = [100,200], power = 150  
Output: 1
