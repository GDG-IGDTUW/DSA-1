Basically, we have to check whether one string is a rotation of another string or not.

ALGORITHM:
1. Check if the length of two given strings is equal. If not, then simply return false. 
Because strings are rotated so length of second string should be equal to the first one.

2. if the 'goal' string is a rotation of string 'str', then string 'str + str' must contains the 'goal' string.
