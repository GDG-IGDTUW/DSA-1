The min-product of an array is equal to the minimum value in the array multiplied by the array's sum.For example, the array [3,2,5] (minimum value is 2) has a min-product of 2 * (3+2+5) = 2 * 10 = 20.
Given an array of integers nums, return the maximum min-product of any non-empty subarray of nums. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that the min-product should be maximized before performing the modulo operation. Testcases are generated such that the maximum min-product without modulo will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2]
Output: 14

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,3,3,1,2]
Output: 18
