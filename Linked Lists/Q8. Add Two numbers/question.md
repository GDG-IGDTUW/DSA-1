You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

<img width="345" height="264" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f328ab84-c955-4e79-91ac-7235b597900e" />


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]

Output: [7,0,8]

Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
