## Approach

We compare nodes from both lists and attach the smaller node to the merged list.

## Algorithm

1. Create a dummy node.
2. Use a pointer to build the merged list.
3. Compare list1 and list2 values.
4. Attach remaining nodes after one list ends.

## Time Complexity

O(n + m)

## Space Complexity

O(1)
