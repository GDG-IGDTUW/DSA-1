Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.


Example:

<img width="301" height="68" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3a1c876-7ff2-4618-bc23-12c0660beaf4" />


Input: head = [1,0,1]

Output: 5

Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
